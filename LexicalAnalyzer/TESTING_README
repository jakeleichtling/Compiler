TESTING
-------

The /testing subfolder contains all of our test input and output files, as well as a convenient run script.

The different token 'genres' are divided into appropriately named files - i.e. string_test, numconst_test, etc. When run_all_tests.sh is executed, corresponding .out files will be generated. These files together represent comprehensive test of all valid (and some invalid) tokens.

We have also included the bellman-ford.cs57 file and a small_test_program.c57 to test the Lexical Analyzer in realistic use.

Happy Testing,
Derek & Jake
