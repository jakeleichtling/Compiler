-----------------------------

Part 2 of the project uses bison, along with the Lexical Analyzer from Part 1,
to build an abstract syntax tree from C57 code. The grammar used is defined
as part of the CS57 Compiler project.

ast.c  & ast.h - syntax tree struct as adopted from THC class lectures

bparser.y - bison parser file

cparser.c - main() function for running bparser and printing tree

flexer.l - lex file for lexical analyzer, slighty modified from Part 1

sst.c & sst.h - "simple string table" for holding IDs and string constants in parse tree

sst_tester.c - main function for testing sst

/testing - directory containing test scripts and files for parser (see TESTING_README for more details)
