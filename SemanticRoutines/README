Semantic Routines
-----------------

Believe it or not, it appears that we have a working compiler on our hands. The Derek-Jake C57 compiler is invoked from the command line with:

djcc [-d] input_C57_file_path [output_TM57_file_path]

Note:

-d (must be the first argument) turns on debugging mode, in which debugging statements are printed to stdout.

If no output path is specified, the output will be written to assembly.tm57 in the current directory. Any compilation errors will be printed to stderr with a corresponding line number.

-----------------------------------------------------
Files:

bparser.y - Bison parser input file

djcc.c - Main function for the Derek-Jake C57 compiler

flexer.l - Flex lexical analyzer input file

quad{.h, .c} - Declarations/definitions for generation of intermediate code from the abstract syntax tree

symtab{.h, .c} - Declarations/definitions for the symbol table

ast{.h, .c} - Declarations/definitions for the abstract syntax tree data structure

tm57_assemgly_generation{.h, .c} - Declarations/definitions for generating assembly instructions from intermediate code

ast_node_processing{.h, .c} - Declarations/definitions for generating symbols from the abstract syntax tree and for error checking (including type checking)
-----------------------------------------------------

For testing, please see the testing directory. Further instructions can be found in TESTING_README and ERROR_TESTING_README.

Thanks for the great class!
