Semantic Routines
-----------------

Believe it or not, it appears that we have a working compiler on our hands. The use for the Derek-Jake c57 compiler is:

djcc [-d] input_C57_file_path [output_TM57_file_path]

If no output path is specified, the output will be written to assembly.tm57. Any compilation errors will be printed to stdout with a line number. 

Files:

bparser.y - bison parser

djcc.c - Main function for the Derek-Jake c57 compiler

flexer.l - flex lexical analyzer

quad.c & h - Handles generation of intermediate code

symtab.c & h - Definition and functions for the symbol table

tm57_assemgly_generation.c & h - Creates assembly code from intermediate code



For testing, please see the /testing file. Further instructions can be found in the TESTING_README and ERROR_TESTING_README.

Thanks for the great class!

Cheers,
Derek Salama & Jake Leichtling
