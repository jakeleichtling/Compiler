CLAIMS
------------------------

Variable-size arrays in the stack are supported. For example, the following code is valid and functions correctly.

{
  ...

  int n = 5;
  int array[n];

  ...
}

This feature is demonstrated in testing/variable_size_array_test.c57.in, which is one of the inputs included in the testing suite run by testing/run_all_tests.sh.
